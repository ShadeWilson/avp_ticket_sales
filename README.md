# avp_ticket_sales
Script to analysis ticket sales for the Academical Village People, an all-male a cappella group at the University of Virginia.

The AVP ticket sales analysis pipeline (AVP_sales_V2.0.R) is the second version of the pipeline I've created. It can be generalized
for use in the future as long as the new data is formatted the same as the other data sets, otherwise more changes will have to be
made.

The data for fall 2016 and spring 2017 is availible in the data file, and the R markdown files can be found in the markdown folder.
